# This Discord Bot is a joke, it is here purely to show of my ability to use this Framework (However little that may be) and does not portray the views of the creator in anyway

# GodBot

# Before First RUN!!!
# Create a file in the root directory called 'token.txt'
# inside this file add your Discord Bot Token into this file (Nothing else except this token string)
